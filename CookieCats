A/B Testing with Cookie Cats Game

In the realm of mobile gaming, maintaining player engagement is paramount. “Cookie Cats,” a captivating puzzle game developed by Tactile Entertainment, serves as an excellent case study for this. The game’s clever integration of “connect three” mechanics with an adorable ensemble of singing cats has charmed players worldwide. However, the strategic placement of progression gates — points where players must either wait or make a purchase to advance — brings a crucial analytical challenge to the forefront: optimizing player retention.

Understanding the Game Mechanics

At its core, “Cookie Cats” employs a common yet effective monetization strategy: progression gates. These gates, strategically placed at certain levels, necessitate either a waiting period or an in-app purchase, ingeniously pacing the gameplay. This mechanic not only drives revenue but also aims to enhance the player’s enjoyment by preventing burnout.

The Analytical Challenge: Gate Placement

The initial placement of the first gate at level 30 posed an interesting question: could player retention be improved by relocating this gate? To explore this, an AB test was conducted, shifting the first gate to level 40 for a subset of players. The goal was to analyze the impact on player retention, an essential metric for the game’s long-term success.
